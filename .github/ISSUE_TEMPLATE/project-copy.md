**Task**
Using the original project proposal as a template, write the copy/text for the project details page on thenewboston.com

We will not be using the text directly from the GitHub project proposal since that information is written more for the 
project reviewers. The copy/text for the project details page on thenewboston.com is more "marketing" content that is 
mainly intended for website visitors.

This task is to write copy for each of the following sections.

- Overview
- Problem
- Target Market
- Benefit to Network & Community
- Centered around TNB

**Copy Requirements**
- As a general guideline, each section should be ~2-3 sentences long
- Must have proper grammar and be understandable from the perspective of an average website visitor

**Links**
- [Original project proposal](https://example.com)
- [TNB project details page](https://example.com)

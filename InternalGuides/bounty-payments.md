# Bounty Payments

This guide will explain the bounty payment system for the marketing team.

## Accepting Bounties

When a user submits content for a bounty that we would like to accept, save that file (typically a graphic) and add it
to our Google Drive folder under `Marketing/Content/Infographics/Not yet posted`.

## Flagging for Payment Due

On the GitHub issue, copy the code below and paste in as a new comment. Fill out the user (which will also notify them)
along with the amount owed.

```

User: 
Amount: 

```

You can then add the `Payment Due` label. Chrisha will send that user the coins and then close the issue.
